### ========== PLOT ========== ###
The plan is to make the manager (owner of The Store) have a speach about how terrible pant is and how we should remove it.
Then GM demonstrates, but since everyone likes both, they can't decide.
The manager says that they will all recieve free ____ if they vote YES.
They vote YES if the player does not have enough evidence of that the manager hates the GM

### ===== LORE LOCATIONS ===== ###
One evidence is hidden in his office (obviousley)
Another is talking to Hilda
